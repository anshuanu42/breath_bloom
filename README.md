# Breath-Bloom (Air Quality Garden)

Problem Statement:
Air pollution in India is a growing crisis, with cities like Delhi hitting hazardous AQI levels above 300, harming health and ecosystems. Yet, awareness remains low—dry data like 'PM2.5: 150' fails to connect emotionally or inspire action. Existing apps lack engagement, offering numbers without impact, leaving people disconnected from the air they breathe. There’s a need for an accessible, emotional, and actionable tool to make air quality personal and drive change, especially in a country where millions need it most.

MY IDEA:
BreathBloom is your personal air quality garden. Here’s how it operates: it utilizes geolocation to determine your position and retrieves real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data. A virtual garden then responds accordingly. For instance, clean air, such as an AQI of 40, results in vibrant flowers blooming, while poor air, such as an AQI of 250, causes plants to wilt and forests to fade. This goes beyond mere visuals; it serves as a call to action. Earn Bloom Points with tasks like ‘use public transport’ to revive it, then redeem them for sustainable goodies—think seed packets or eco-bags. It’s free, emotional, and a call to act.

Technical feasibility:
BreathBloom is not just a vision, it’s a fully feasible app. We are using Flutter, a cross-platform framework, to ensure the app runs smoothly across Android and iOS. For real-time AQI we are using AQICN’s free API paired with geolocator for instant location detection. For visuals we are using Flutter animation tools and also few videos that are available on internet to make visuals very realistic. Bloom Points earned from tasks like ‘plant a tree’ can be redeemed for small sustainable products like seed packets, making it engaging and scalable.

Impact & Vision:
BreathBloom can change India’s air story. It’s more than an app—it’s a movement. Emotional visuals spark awareness—watching your garden die hits harder than numbers. Gamified tasks drive action—millions could plant trees, cut car use, and clean rivers, one point at a time. It’s free and scalable, hitting every phone with real-time, region-specific data.
Picture this: urban smog drops, rural air stays pure, all because people cared enough to act. This is sustainability with soul—built today, for tomorrow’s cleaner air.

Conclusion:
BreathBloom transforms air quality awareness into action. By showing a virtual garden that blooms with clean air or wilts under pollution—using real-time AQI or manual input—it makes the invisible visible. It empowers users to fight pollution, from planting trees to reducing emissions. Free, scalable, and emotionally engaging, BreathBloom helps millions in India connect with their air, inspiring personal and collective change for a cleaner future.
